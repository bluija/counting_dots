# Visual collaborative experiment
Run index.html using chrome. Browser console will log the data after every trial.

There are 5 AI conditions in the experiment. In `script.js`, set `const condition` to 1/2/3/4/5, corresponding to conditions A/B/C/D/E in the paper. 

The ai[0-5].R generates the toy AI data in data[0-5].json which are then imported into the experiment.
